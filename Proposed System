The bluetooth chat application that is developed here is done by only
python. Usually they are built through Java due to availability of the module.
In python there is a bluetooth package called py-bluez that is to be
downloaded and used for the access of bluetooth in the coding.

Python is used to develop because it is easier to code and it is much
more comfortable to make future updates with. We have used Tkinter for the
interface within python. This app for now is developed in such a way it works
with one system. When it is developed further, many more devices can be
added and communicated in the same way. Even in this code, it only works if
the system's bluetooth is switched on. Hence the application will work only if
there is bluetooth. Internet connection is not required.

This chat application will be very useful for organizations to
communicate effortlessly even if their server is down. So there is no need to
worry about sending important messages while there is no connection. But it
is to note that since bluetooth is only for a short range, this application will
work only within 100m of range.
